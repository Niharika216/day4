    <p>The film city is the brainchild of media tycoon and film producer Ramoji Rao, who wanted to build a studio similar to the ones in Hollywood.On procuring the land, he signed art director Nitish Roy to design the complex. According to an executive, the builders kept the land, which at that time consisted of jungles and mountainous terrain, intact, without removing one tree or mountain. It was built in Hyderabad in 1996 in the outskirts of the city in Abdullahpurmet.Maa Naannaku Pelli (1997) was the first film shot in the studio.</p>
