    <p>The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire.The name Golconda is thought to originate from Telugu for "Cowherd's hill" (romanized: Gullakōnḍa).It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199-1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region.The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.</p>
